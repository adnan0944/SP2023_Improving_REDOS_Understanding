# RegexAnalyzer

Apply language-level definition of ambiguity, resolved through automaton analysis.

For ANTLR to work you need to add antlr-4.7.2-complete.jar as an external library

which can be downloaded from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/antlr/antlr4/4.7.2/


Also add BRICS jar.
# Usage

Try this:

```
CLASSPATH=deps/automaton-1.12-2.jar java src/RegexAnalyzer.java  
```
